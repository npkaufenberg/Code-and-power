    <p>Implicit bias is the attitude or internalized stereotypes that unconsciously affect our perceptions, actions, and decisions. These unconscious biases often affect behavior that leads to unequal treatment of people based on race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, health status, and other characteristics.</p>

        Implicit biases simultaneously advantage certain groups while disadvantaging others. These biases can be seen in university admissions, job recruiting and selection, and even in the classroom. They greatly affect diversity in a number of ways.
